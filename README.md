## Project Description
‘**EduReview360**’ is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to address the challenges faced in collecting, analyzing, and utilizing feedback from participants enrolled in training programs. This **Training Feedback System** provides an efficient and centralized solution for evaluating training program effectiveness, assessing instructor performance, and identifying areas for improvement.

## User Modules
### Participant Module
Participants can register for training sessions, submit feedback, access feedback history and reports, and optionally provide anonymous feedback.
### Instructor Module
Instructors can view information about their training sessions, access participant feedback, review comments and ratings, respond to feedback, and use insights to improve their training techniques.
### Administrator Module
Administrators can create and customize feedback surveys, manage participant data, monitor attendance and feedback submission, analyze feedback data, track instructor evaluations, implement user authentication and access control, and identify feedback trends and insights for program improvement.

## Tech Stack

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
